        <h2>Chicken Potpie Tips</h2>

        <h3>How do you keep a pot pie crust from getting soggy?</h3>

        <p>There are a few ways to prevent a soggy pie crust! For a single-crust pie, the easiest way to keep it from getitng soggy is to prebake (or blind bake) the crust before filling. You can also brush the crust with a beaten egg white, which will help seal the crust and prevent the liquid filling from absorbing into the crust. You could also bake the pie on a lower rack in the oven. Because heat is concentrated at the bottom, placing the potpie on the lowest rack ensures the bottom of the crust will bake up crisp and golden brown.

        <h3>How do I add a bottom crust to this chicken pot pie?</h3>

        <p>To add a bottom crust to your chicken pot pie, after rolling your pie dough, unroll it carefully into a greased 9-in. deep-dish pie plate; trim even with the rim. Add chicken mixture. Unroll remaining crust and place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in top.</p>
